officers, who are 3rd, 4th and 5th, etc. in seniority, will choose their shift  assignments in the same manner, provided that each  police officer must sign up  for a shift with week days off once within a twelve (12) month period.        b. this policy shall not apply to police officers assigned to a particular shift while on   special assignment including, for example, the school resource

maintained according to the needs of the specialized assignment.       2. the intent of an established core work week is to provide the officer   continuity in the number of consecutive days and hours worked during the  term of assignment; however, the core work week may be subject to  temporary change upon reasonable notice due to a special circumstance,  for example: patrol shift replacement due to illness or vacation, training,  an emergency, or to accomplish a unique need of the specialized  assignment.      b. a \"shift\" is defined as the designated days and working hours of the employee's   core work week.  specialized assignments are subject to fluctuating shifts based  on the needs of the assignment.  unless impractical under the circumstances, at  least one weeks’ notice

assignment, the police chief may designate a  reasonable method for assigning personnel to cover the open shift.  unless  impractical under the circumstances, officers transferring between general patrol  and specialized assignments shall assume the other's work week and shift.   officers transferred into general patrol will be eligible for seniority shift rotation  during the next scheduled sign-up period.      d. the creation and termination of specialized assignments, the duties of such   assignments, the appointment of officers to such assignments, and the duration  of such

requirements for  compensatory time held \"on the books,\" but the maximum any employee may  accumulate is one hundred (100) hours, unless previously approved by the police  chief.      8.02 for the computation of overtime pay, all sick leave, vacation, holiday and compensatory   time used by an employee will be figured as part of that employee's workweek.    section ix  leave of absence    9.01 members of the association shall receive credit for thirteen (13) holidays per year.  the   thirteen (13) holidays per year shall be computed on an eight (8) hour day consisting of  a maximum of one hundred four (104) hours per year.  holiday compensation shall be  based on the calendar year with the first fifty-two (52) hours of holiday time to be paid in  a regular payroll check to eligible

accrued vacation or holiday bank if applicable.  this exchange will be paid in  conjunction with the final salary payment in march.  additionally, upon reaching an  employee’s third (3rd) anniversary

notify the human resources department  and shall enroll in one of the medical plans offered by the city. for employees who  receive the \"cash in-lieu\" benefit on july 1, 2014, the benefit amount

obligations governing the calculation and   payment of contractual overtime as defined in section 8.01 above, the city will  calculate and pay overtime as required under the fair labor standards act

coverage, the following formulas shall be used to calculate the portion of the  employee’s regular rate of pay that is comprised of cash in lieu of medical coverage:     o for those employees who receive $300 per month:  $300/173.33 = 1.73   x 1.5 = $2.595 paid per hour over 40 hours in a seven day work period.     o for those employees who receive $668.63 per month:  $668.63/173.33  = 3.86 x 1.5 = $5.79 paid per hour over 40 hours in a seven day work  period.      the city will determine the amount of flsa overtime owed the employee, if any, for   the seven day work period.  to the extent the amount of flsa overtime owed  exceeds the amount of contractual overtime paid for that work period pursuant to  section 7.01, the city will pay the employee the difference by way of an “flsa pay  adjustment” no later than the following pay day using the above-described formulas.     17              section xi  dental insurance     the city shall pay full dental coverage for members of this
